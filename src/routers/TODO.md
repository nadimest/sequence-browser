# Future Improvements and Known Limitations

## User Interface Enhancements
1. Implement advanced gene search functionality
   - Current implementation requires exact gene name
   - Consider adding autocomplete and fuzzy search capabilities
   - Add support for alternative gene identifiers

2. Enhance reference list presentation
   - Restructure references as properly formatted numbered citations
   - Improve parsing of raw database text
   - Consider adding DOI links and proper academic citation format

3. Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Implement more informative "Gene Not Found" responses
   - Add meaningful error messages for various edge cases
   - Consider adding suggestions for similar gene names when exact match fails

## Technical Debt and Optimization

### Storage and Data Management
1. Optimize storage efficiency
   - Implement compressed PDB file format for object storage
   - Review and optimize database schema
   - Consider implementing caching mechanisms

2. Security Enhancements
   - Resolve private bucket access issues
   - Implement proper access control mechanisms
   - Review and enhance overall storage security

### Pipeline Improvements

#### RCSB Integration
1. Current Limitations:
   - Lack of reliable programmatic access using gene names
   - Incomplete mapping between gene names and PDB structures
   - Need for better intermediate resolution steps (gene → UniProt → PDB)

2. Needed Improvements:
   - Research alternative RCSB API query methods
   - Implement better structure selection criteria
   - Add version control for PDB files

#### AlphaFold Pipeline
1. Current Status:
   - Successfully implemented gene_name → UniProt_ID → AlphaFold_PDB workflow
   - Reliable structure retrieval

2. Potential Enhancements:
   - Implement structure version checking
   - Add metadata validation
   - Consider implementing structure quality assessment

## Data Quality and Curation
1. Database Content Review
   - Conduct systematic review of database entries
   - Validate biological relevance of stored information
   - Implement quality control metrics

2. User Experience Validation
   - Perform end-user testing with domain experts
   - Validate data presentation from a biological perspective
   - Gather feedback on information usefulness and accuracy

## Documentation
1. API Documentation
   - Document all endpoints and their usage
   - Provide clear examples and use cases
   - Include error handling guidelines

2. User Guide
   - Create comprehensive user documentation
   - Include typical workflows and best practices
   - Document known limitations and workarounds
